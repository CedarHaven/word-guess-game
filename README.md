# Word Guess Game (Hangman)

This is a prehistoric (mostly dinosaur)-themed hangman game. You hit any key to being the game, at which point the game selects a random word, displays on screen the same number of dashes as there are letters in the word, and then lets you enter guesses until you either run out of guesses and lose or guess the word correctly. If you guess a letter correctly, the display fills in the appropriate letter in the appropriate spots. You get six guesses, because in traditional hangman, there's a guess for the head, body, both arms, and both legs. The game also keeps track of letters you've already guessed and displays them on screen for you to see, and also will not take a guess away if you guess the same letter multiple times.
If you win, you get an alert telling you that you've won and also what the word was; if you lose, you get an alert telling you that you've lost and also what the word was.
